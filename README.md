# jogger

** This package is now superseded by my `boundr` package, which avoids lots of the bad design decisions in `jogger`. Please use that instead! **

### Retrieve area boundaries and data from the ONS Open Geography Portal

The main function of this package is to download area lookups and
boundaries (in GeoJSON format) using the ONS Open Geography API, for all
sub-areas - at a specified level - within a specified area. The main
script will return a data frame with the sub-area geometry column, as an
`sf` object ready to be visualised as a map. It’s initially just for
areas within England and Wales, with a hope to add Scottish geographies
at a later date. And currently just for the following area levels: LSOA,
MSOA, Ward, LAD/LTLA, UTLA/CTY, CAUTH, RGN *\[subject to change\]*
